# Derived mainly from Pluralsight courses
This is an Angular App that puts together various good practices such as :

- Unit tests
- Integrated tests (shallow + deep)
- End to End tests
- Lint
- Husky for triggering lint on commit ( must also trigger unit test execution on push  which is a really good practice)
- Use of recommended module : core module, shared module and feature modules with lazy loaded components
- Various environments handling
- Test prod build with lite-server

Where to go next :
- Handle immutability
